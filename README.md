# Fusion Vision:
The idea behind this project is to build an end-to-end application where the user can control a novel image creation process by feeding in an audio snippet.

# Inspiration
The inspiration came from an [artwork by prominent artist Mario Klingemann](https://youtu.be/A6bo_mIOto0) (*For the brave: play it at 0.25x if you want to see some eerie faces*).

# Technology
The latent spaces of a generative adversarial network called [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) will be explored based on the techniques used in the [GANSpace](https://github.com/harskish/ganspace) paper and interesting controls will be shortlisted. These controls are then mapped to an audio signal and can be controlled using a friendly user interface.
