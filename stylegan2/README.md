# StyleGAN2 in PyTorch
This is a fork of [Kim Seonghyeon's repo](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch) at 609911be93f8e7bb5ad3277dbcaf3fc66a7f472c on master. Below is a part of the original README.

## Usage

First create lmdb datasets:

> python prepare_data.py --out LMDB_PATH --n_worker N_WORKER --size SIZE1,SIZE2,SIZE3,... DATASET_PATH

This will convert images to jpeg and pre-resizes it. This implementation does not use progressive growing, but you can create multiple resolution datasets using size arguments with comma separated lists, for the cases that you want to try another resolutions later.

Then you can train model in distributed settings

> python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=N_GPU --master_port=PORT train.py --batch BATCH_SIZE LMDB_PATH

train.py supports Weights & Biases logging. If you want to use it, add --wandb arguments to the script.

### Convert weight from official checkpoints

You need to clone the official repository (https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) as it is requires for load official checkpoints.

For example, if you cloned repository in ~/stylegan2 and downloaded stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pkl, You can convert it like this:

> python convert_weight.py --repo ~/stylegan2 stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pkl

This will create converted stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pt file.

### Generate samples

> python generate.py --sample N_FACES --pics N_PICS --ckpt PATH_CHECKPOINT

You should change your size (--size 256 for example) if you trained with another dimension.

### Project images to latent spaces

> python projector.py --ckpt [CHECKPOINT] --size [GENERATOR_OUTPUT_SIZE] FILE1 FILE2 ...

### Closed-Form Factorization (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06600)

You can use `closed_form_factorization.py` and `apply_factor.py` to discover meaningful latent semantic factor or directions in unsupervised manner.

First, you need to extract eigenvectors of weight matrices using `closed_form_factorization.py`

> python closed_form_factorization.py [CHECKPOINT]

This will create factor file that contains eigenvectors. (Default: factor.pt) And you can use `apply_factor.py` to test the meaning of extracted directions

> python apply_factor.py -i [INDEX_OF_EIGENVECTOR] -d [DEGREE_OF_MOVE] -n [NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES] --ckpt [CHECKPOINT] [FACTOR_FILE]

For example,

> python apply_factor.py -i 19 -d 5 -n 10 --ckpt [CHECKPOINT] factor.pt

Will generate 10 random samples, and samples generated from latents that moved along 19th eigenvector with size/degree +-5.

## Requirements
* PyTorch 1.3.1
* CUDA 10.1/10.2


## Pretrained Checkpoints

I have trained the 256px model on FFHQ 550k iterations. I got FID about 4.5. Maybe data preprocessing, resolution, training loop could made this difference, but currently I don't know the exact reason of FID differences.

To match FID scores more closely to tensorflow official implementations, I have used FID Inception V3 implementations in https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid
